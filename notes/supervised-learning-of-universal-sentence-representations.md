## [Supervised Learning of Universal Sentence Representations from Natural Language Inference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364)

TLDR; The authors show that supervised training on the NLI task can produce high-quality "universal" sentence embeddings which outperform other existing models, on transfer tasks. They train the sentence vectors on the SNLI corpus using 4 different sentence encoding model architectures.
